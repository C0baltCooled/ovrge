# Open Source Virtual Reality Game Engine
> **A framework meant to create highly performant VR experiences.**

Features
---
- **Fast** - Written in a DOD C++ Design Pattern, it's designed specifically for games.
- **Open Source Standard Support** - Supports fast, optimized for games, open source technology.
- **Cross-Platform** - Works on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android
- **Cross-Device** - Works on SteamVR, Oculus Standalone/Desktop, and WMR

Goals
---
- **OpenGL and Vulkan Support** - Open source graphics APIs come first, supporting every platform
- **glTF2.0 and KTX** - Open source file formats, making it easier to import files for your game

Tradeoffs
---
- **No editor** - No editor means more work in other tools. Hopefully we can leverage the power of glTF/KTX/Vulkan and other open source tools to ease things.
